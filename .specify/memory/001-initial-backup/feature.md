# Feature Specification: Initial Backup System

**Feature ID:** 001-initial-backup  
**Branch:** main (initial release)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Overview

Automated backup system for Neat.com document libraries, enabling IT professionals to export their entire document collection to local organized storage with a single click.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**Manual Export Process:**
- Users must manually click through 20-25 folders
- Each folder contains 30-50 files (500-1,250 files total)

- **Total time: 20+ hours of repetitive clicking**

**Data Risk:**
- No local backup of critical business documents
- Reliance on cloud service availability
- Accidental deletions are permanent
- No version control or audit trail

**Scalability Issues:**
- Process doesn't scale with document growth
- New folders require same manual effort
- No automation possible with current approach

### Target Users

- Managing corporate Neat.com accounts
- Responsible for data backup compliance
- Technical proficiency with desktop applications
- Need reliable, auditable backup solutions

**Secondary:** Small business owners
- Using Neat.com for document organization
- Limited technical expertise
- Need simple, GUI-based tools

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Neat.com UI Changes
**Impact:** High - Selenium selectors break  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Use stable selectors (data-testid attributes)
- Document selector maintenance process
- Provide user-friendly selector update guide

### Risk 2: Rate Limiting
**Impact:** Medium - Backup fails or slows  
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Sequential processing (no parallelization)
- Configurable delays between operations
- Respect Neat.com API usage patterns

### Risk 3: Download Failures
**Impact:** Medium - Files missing from backup  
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Timeout configuration (30s default)
- Retry logic (max 3 attempts)
- Clear logging of failures
- Continue on error (don't abort entire backup)

### Risk 4: Credential Security
**Impact:** High - Credential compromise  
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Mitigation:**
- Fernet encryption (industry standard)
- Separate key storage
- No plaintext logging
- User consent before saving
